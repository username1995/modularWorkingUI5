Installing Node.js is a prerequisite. Installing the [UI5 CLI](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling#installing-the-ui5-cli) will also be needed. Generally, if you're able to run the [OpenUI5 Basic Template App](https://github.com/SAP/openui5-basic-template-app) in your local environment you should be able to run this.

Clone the git repository in your device, open a terminal and navigate to the project folder, and execute:

```sh
npm i
npm start
```
